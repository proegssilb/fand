# fand - a fan controlling daemon


## RUNNING

Run, as root:
# fand /path/to/your/config.conf


## CONFIGURATION

Configuration files are using a simple yet powerful
LISP-like syntax which allows sensor values to be
manipulated in many ways.

Below a small example of what a configuration file
may look like when controlling only the CPU fan.

```
  (sensor "cputemp" (hwmon-sensor "hwmon1" "temp1_input"))
  
  (fan "cpufan" (hwmon-pwm "hwmon2" "pwm1"))

  (output "cpufan"
    (maximum
      (panic "45" "50" (sensor-input "cputemp"))
      (smooth "10"
        (steps
          (step "30" "0.00")
          (step "45" "0.65")
          (sensor-input "cputemp")))))
```

In this config, `hwmon-sensor` and `hwmon-pwm` refer
to files in `/sys/class/hwmon`. However, on modern
systems, these are often USB-based, and can move
around significantly. Consider using the following
command to use a friendlier label in your config
files:

`cat /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon*/name | nl -v 0`

The previous example might look like this if you made
that choice with an AMD cpu:

```
  (sensor "cputemp" (hwmon-sensor "k10temp" "temp1_input"))
  
  (fan "cpufan" (hwmon-pwm "it8792" "pwm1"))

  (output "cpufan"
    (maximum
      (panic "45" "50" (sensor-input "cputemp"))
      (smooth "10"
        (steps
          (step "30" "0.00")
          (step "45" "0.65")
          (sensor-input "cputemp")))))
```

Sensor readings are given in celsius (as opposed
to milli celsius in sysfs), and fan speeds are
given as a floating-point number between 0 and 1.

Sensors and fans are named. Sensors can be used
as inputs multiple times using the 'sensor-input'
tag, whereas fans should only be used once.

In order to test your configuration prior to actually
applying it, you can choose to display fan speeds -
again, given as a floating point number between 0 and
1 - on the console. To do that, modify the fan entry:

```
(fan "cpufan" (console-fan "PWM 1"))
```

where "PWM 1" is the display name of that fan.

The 'output' tag links an input to a fan, meaning that
this is what will actually control fan speeds. The first
argument is a named fan, 'cpufan' in our example, whereas
the second argument is an input sequence that produces a
number. Numbers outside the range [0..1] will be cut off.

There are the following input sources and modifiers:

  - `(sensor-input "sensor")`
      Reads the value of a named temperature sensor,
      in degrees celsius.
  - `(steps (step "a1" "b1") (step "a2" "b2") ... (input))`
      Maps an input to a different range, preferably the
      [0..1] range. If the number produced by the given
      input is between a1 and b2, the resulting value will
      be between b1 and b2.
  - `(smooth "n" (input))`
      Makes the resulting fan curve smooth by computing the
      average of the previous "n" values.
  - `(panic "target" "critical" (input))`
      Returns 1.0 (full fan speed) when the input temperature
      exceeds the "critical" temperature, and 0.0 (fan off)
      when it drops below the "target" temperature. Most useful
      in combination with (maximum).
  - `(maximum (input1) (input2) ...)`
      Computes the maximum value of all the inputs given.
  - `(cutoff "off-below" "start-above" "start-value" (input))`
      Turns the fans off when the input temperature drops
      below the "off-below" value, and starts them when
      it rises above the "start-above" value. "start-value"
      is the fan speed used to start the fans, which might
      have to be much higher than the minimum rotation speed.

Below another full configuration example:

```
  (sensor "gpu"  (hwmon-sensor "hwmon0" "temp1_input"))
  (sensor "cpu"  (hwmon-sensor "hwmon1" "temp1_input"))
  (sensor "sock" (hwmon-sensor "hwmon2" "temp1_input"))
  (sensor "case" (hwmon-sensor "hwmon2" "temp2_input"))

  (fan "cpu"  (hwmon-pwm "hwmon2" "pwm1"))
  (fan "case" (hwmon-pwm "hwmon2" "pwm3"))

  (output "cpu"
    (maximum
      (panic "60" "65" (sensor-input "cpu"))
      (smooth "7"
        (steps
          (step "45" "0.00")
          (step "60" "0.65")
          (sensor-input "cpu")))))

  (output "case"
    (cutoff "0.19" "0.25" "0.4"
      (maximum
        (panic "80" "82" (sensor-input "gpu"))
        (panic "48" "52" (sensor-input "case"))
        (panic "65" "70" (sensor-input "sock"))
        (smooth "10"
          (maximum
            (steps
              (step "50" "0.00")
              (step "50" "0.19")
              (step "55" "0.25")
              (step "80" "0.75")
              (sensor-input "gpu"))
            (steps
              (step "38" "0.00")
              (step "38" "0.19")
              (step "40" "0.25")
              (step "48" "0.60")
              (step "50" "0.75")
              (sensor-input "case"))
            (steps
              (step "40" "0.19")
              (step "50" "0.25")
              (step "65" "0.75")
              (sensor-input "sock")))))))
```
